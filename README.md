# Dribbble Components with React

## Steps

+ Fork the next [repo](https://codepen.io/agzeri/pen/EQvveP) into your Codepen account.
+ Configure the pen to use **React** and **ReactDOM**. Add those libraries in that order.
+ Create the App component which will render the whole application.
+ You may need to create only two components more
  + One for _Dribbble shot_
  + Next one for _stats_ (views, likes, comments)

## Deliverables
+ A Codepen link to validate the code
